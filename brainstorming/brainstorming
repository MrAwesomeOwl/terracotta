brainstorming:
CurrentLine = [global variable,=,string]

States need to keep track of their parents

==========================================================

State = Main[
    #### sees global keyword, enter variable state
    Variable[
        #### sees space, knows this must be a simpleNameVariable
        VariableName []: returns the name of the variable as a string
        #### we got a variable name, push variable to the line
    ],

    #### we got a variable in this line!! check for an action
    VariableAction[
        #### sees =, add it to the line
    ]

    #### line looks like this: [global variable, =]
    #### which means we assinging a var!!! so lets get the value as an expr
    Expression: [
        #### expression keeps its own internal value of the expression from left to right
        #### sees " as next character: this must be a string
        String [
            #### keep adding until either next \ or next "
            #### backslash found! add next character to string, ignoring any operations it would otherwise perform
            #### keep going...
            #### " found!! string is complete, return that to the Expression
        ]
        #### add string that was just recieved to the current stored expression
        #### next char is a newline, automatically end the expression
    ]

    #### newline: finish line and push to line stack
